std2 is a standard standard library. Primarily targeted for puuro interpreter.

I was fustrated that I couldn't find an easy-to-steal standard library anywhere
so I decided to write my own. std2 simply tries to wrap C libraries in a
crash-safe and non-blocking way. Neither of these can't be always guaranteed,
so std2 also supports forking any module to a different process.
